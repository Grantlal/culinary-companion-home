# Culinary Companion Home
This is the service that essentially will act as a connector between each of the services and the front-end.
The Home API works as a facade between the culinary companion website and back-end microservices. The purpose of this is to hide more of the authentication from the customer facing website and only have one place it interacts with.

### Getting Started
Requirements: 
- Ensure you have .Net Core installed. --> https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
- Also install the IDE of your choice, I highly recommend JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio

Shouldn't be too much more to getting the software to run other than hitting the run button. Happy debugging!
